## 1. About CVE-2019-11477

- The newly discovered Linux vulnerabilities, CVE-2019-11477, CVE-2019-11478, and CVE-2019-11479, affect all Linux operating systems newer than kernel 2.6.29 (released on March 2009) or above and can cause a kernel panic to systems with services listening on a TCP connection. This remote attack can put a server into a Denial of Service (DoS) state, but remote code execution is not of concern. The vulnerability roots on the flaws in the TCP Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) and Maximum Segment Size (MSS) implementation. The attack can be triggered by a remote user who sets the MSS to the lowest limit of 48 bytes and sends a sequence of specially crafted SACK packets to overflow the receiverâ€™s socket buffer. Most of the Linux distributions have released a patch, RedHat, Ubuntu, and openSUSE. If immediately patching the system is not possible, the attack can also be blocked by firewall rules or traffic control policies. As the attack is fairly simple, a proof of concept (POC) exploit should be available soon and we expect to see large-scale DDoS attacks within a few days as attackers exploit unprotected systems.
